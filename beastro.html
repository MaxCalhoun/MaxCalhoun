									<p>In Beastro Brunch, Lunch, 'N' Dinner!?!, you play as a restaurant owner trying to make a name for herself. During business hours, customers will dine-in, requesting a specific meal. The character cooks the meal in the kitchen using their stockpiled ingredients, and must deliver it to the diner in a timely manner. There are two ways of obtaining ingredients. You can grow them on the farm by planting seeds, or you can venture into the wilderness and hunt the roaming monsters.</p>
									<p>While building Beastro, I contributed to several aspects of the game. In the begining, I worked on the character movement and animations, and the healing and dodging parts of the combat system. Afterwards I shifted to creating additional content such as item pickups and enemies. At the end of the development cycle I implemented the save system for the game.</p>

									<p>Beastro Brunch, Lunch, 'N' Dinner!?! is a game I worked on with nine other students over the course of a semester for our capstone project. Our goal in developing this project was to create a restaurant manager game where the player has to farm and hunt for their ingredients. Because we had several key sections of gameplay to develop, our larger team of ten was split into three smaller groups. Group A worked on the restaurant manager side of the game, Group B developed the hunting aspect of gameplay, and Group C created the farming section. I was a member of group B.</p>
									<p>Over the course of building Beastro, I contributed to several aspects of the game. For the first few iterations, I worked on the character movement and animations, and the healing and dodging parts of the combat system. Afterwards I created the collectible items within the hunting grounds and implemented an enemy. At the end of the development cycle I implemented the save system for the game.</p>
